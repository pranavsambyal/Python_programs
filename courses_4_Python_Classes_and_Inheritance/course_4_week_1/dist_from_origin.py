'''Create a class called Animal that accepts two numbers as inputs and assigns them respectively to two instance
variables: arms and legs. Create an instance method called limbs that, when called, returns the total number of limbs
the animal has. To the variable name spider, assign an instance of Animal that has 4 arms and 4 legs. Call the limbs
method on the spider instance and save the result to the variable name spidlimbs.'''
